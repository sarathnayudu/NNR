<strong>
    <u>Temperature Controlled Concrete:-</u>
</strong>
<br /><br />
<p>Placement tempratures much below ambient temperatures and can be designed less than 25 degree celsious or as per client requirement.</p>
<br />
<strong>
    <u>Applications:-</u>
</strong>Mass Raft Foundations,Bridge Foundations,Large Retaining Walls.
<br /><br />
<strong>
    <u>Fiber Reinforced Concrete:-</u>
</strong>
<br /><br />
<p>PP Fibers concrete controls minor shrinkage cracks which usually occurs during the process of hydration. Steel fibers concrete increases its structural intregrity mainly tensile strength when compared to normal concrete.</p>
<br />
<strong>
    <u>Applications:-</u>
</strong>All Building Terrace Slabs,Industial floors,Concrete Pavements.
<br /><br />
<strong>
    <u>High Strength Concrete:-</u>
</strong>
<br /><br />
<p>Which Offers Significantly higher strength than traditional concrete.Because of this you can reduce structural component sizes and therefore the concrete used also less. Hence it’s economical for high rise buildings.</p>
<br />
<strong>
    <u>High Strength Concrete:-</u>
</strong>Precast Elements,Marine Structures,High Rise Buildings Columns&Buildings.
<br />
<br />
<strong>
    <u>Self Compacting Concrete:-</u>
</strong>
<br /><br />
<p>Which is used in structures where in congested reinforcement. Compaction is not required for this concrete. You can get better surface finsh,No Honey Combs&Voids.</p>
<br />
<strong>
    <u>Applications:-</u>
</strong>RCC Members with tight reinforcement,Walls & Pile Foundations.
<br /><br />
<strong>
    <u>Light Weight Concrete:-</u>
</strong>
<br /><br />
<p>Which is 50-75% lighter than normal concrete. Excellent Thermal & Sound Insulation. Reduction in Structures Dead load.</p>
<br />
<strong>
    <u>Applications:-</u>
</strong>Construction of Partition Walls,Roofs&Fillers in Sunken Slab.
<br /><br />
<strong>
    <u>Eco Friendly Concrete:-</u>
</strong>
<br /><br />
<p>An Environment Friendly,high performance,durable,designed to build sustainable structures and protect the environment.</p>
<br />
<strong>
    <u>Applications:-</u>
</strong>Mass Foundations,Under Ground Structures,All concrete works.
<br />
<br />
