            VIJAYAWADA: VNS Ready Mix, a new ready mix plant, is coming up at Kolanukonda in Tadepalli mandal of Guntur district with the promise of making standard and high quality ready mix for durability of structures.

            The plant, which is promoted by Vallabhaneni Venkateswara Rao, Challagundla Nageswara Rao and Abburu Srinivasa Rao, who have experience in civil works and construction industry, has been built at a cost of Rs.5 crores. It would be inaugurated on Sunday. Mr. Nageswara Rao said at a press conference on Friday that the construction industry had been depending a lot on ready mix in the wake of scarcity of labour, but it was also suffering much on account of supply of low-quality ready mix due to mixing of fly ash to the extent of as high as 40 per cent.
