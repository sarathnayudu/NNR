<p><strong><u>Temperature Controlled Concrete:-</u></strong></p>
<p>Placement tempratures much below ambient temperatures and can be designed less than 25 degree celsious or as per client requirement.</p>
<p><b>Applications:-</b>Mass Raft Foundations,Bridge Foundations,Large Retaining Walls.</p>

<p><strong><u>Fiber Reinforced Concrete:-</u></strong></p>
<p>PP Fibers concrete controls minor shrinkage cracks which usually occurs during the process of hydration.
Steel fibers concrete increases its structural intregrity mainly tensile strength when compared to normal concrete.</p>
<p><b>Applications:-</b>All Building Terrace Slabs,Industial floors,Concrete Pavements.</p>

<p><strong><u>High Strength Concrete:-</u></strong></p>
<p>Which Offers Significantly higher strength than traditional concrete.Because of this you can reduce structural component sizes and therefore the concrete used also less.
Hence it’s economical for high rise buildings.</p>
<p><b>Applications:-</b>Precast Elements,Marine Structures,High Rise Buildings Columns&Buildings.</p>

<p><strong><u>Self Compacting Concrete:-</u></strong></p>
<p>Which is used in structures where in congested reinforcement.
Compaction is not required for this concrete.
You can get better surface finsh,No Honey Combs&Voids.</p>
<p><b>Applications:-</b>RCC Members with tight reinforcement,Walls & Pile Foundations.</p>

<p><strong><u>Light Weight Concrete:-</u></strong></p>
<p>Which is 50-75% lighter than normal concrete.
Excellent Thermal & Sound Insulation.
Reduction in Structures Dead load.</p>
<p><b>Applications:-</b>Construction of Partition Walls,Roofs&Fillers in Sunken Slab.</p>

<p><strong><u>Eco Friendly Concrete:-</u></strong></p>
<p>An Environment Friendly,high performance,durable,designed to build sustainable structures and protect the environment.</p>
<p><b>Applications:-</b>Mass Foundations,Under Ground Structures,All concrete works.</p>
